# Old-Car-Price-Prediction
A machine learning model that uses linear regression to predict the resale value of cars.
In today's world, owning a car is a necessity for various purposes, such as transportation to work and medical appointments. However, due to current economic
challenges, purchasing a new car can be a financial burden. Consequently, the demand for affordable used cars has increased, making used car pricing a significant
issue that could impact our sustainable way of living. This research aims to address this problem and provide practical solutions by utilizing various machine
learning techniques and big data tools to estimate used car prices. Specifically, we develop a linear regression model that ensures accuracy with minimal errors
and better results
